# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN and ANN  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits (0-9) using two neural network architectures:  
1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: A feedforward neural network designed for basic digit recognition.  
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: A deep learning model leveraging convolutional layers for superior image recognition.  

Both models are trained and tested on the **MNIST dataset**, a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision.

## Features  
- Implements two architectures (ANN and CNN) for digit recognition.
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras libraries for model building and training.  
- Includes accuracy metrics, loss visualization, and predictions for test images.  

---

## Dataset  
The **MNIST dataset** contains:  
- 60,000 training images.  
- 10,000 test images.  

Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel representation of a handwritten digit.
